# WHAT HAPPENED? 
So basically, what happened is when I was ready to upload the project to GitHub,
the project started acting weird, shortly after I realized I have some memory management
problems going on in my code.
A long time ago I decided to do something with it, but I never did.
A few days ago I started recreating this project, with updated 
neural network library.
I started doing everything again from scratch,
from now on I will be updating the repository till
the project will be bugs-free and fully working,
the way it was supposed to.

~~NRA is an app made of my three programs that can recognize handwritten digits. 
The library I used to create a neural network, test and run it was made by a friend of mine, 
I'm obligated to share his GitHub account: http://github.com/DrwalinPCF~~

~~Libraries Used:~~

~~NeuralNetwork - Library made by Marek Zalewski aka Drwalin aka DrwalinPCF
https://github.com/DrwalinPCF/NeuralNetwork~~

~~SFML - Simple and Fast Multimedia Library
https://www.sfml-dev.org
The rest of the libraries are just standard libraries, like iostream, or fstream.~~

~~NRA consist of 3 programs:~~

~~NNN - Numbers Neural Network
This program learns how to recognize handwritten digits, from the MNIST data set.~~

~~dataPrep - Data Preparation
This program takes pictures of many digits from MNIST, and then using SFML changes them to the array of 0's or 1's according to the luminescence of each pixel.~~

~~PA - PaintApp
The program allows you to draw, and save images you drew. Not only it saves what u drew but it scales it to 28x28 image like the data from MNIST is saved, so the dataPrep app can prepare inputs and pass it to NNN to finally get predicted number.~~
